# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer:
    - A function is a working statement that takes an argument and returns the value of said statement.

  Researched answer:
    - A function is a reusable block of instructions (code), that ca be called on throughout the the code and return an outcome. Arguments behave as local variables



2. What is the difference between .map() and .filter()?

  Your answer:
    - A .map() is an addition to a function that rewrites the output into different form.

    - A .filter() is an addition to a function that helps you filter through arrays and returns a specific data set.

  Researched answer:
    - A .map() is a built in method that takes a function as an argument, iterates it and returns it as  an    array, takes an array and calls a function for every element in the array.

    - A .filter() is also a built in method, but it has its own if/else statement, it iterates original array with function and an argument that tests and outputs a new specific array.



3. What is the difference between console.log() and return?

  Your answer:
    - A console.log() is a command to tell your local computer to run code and "log" me an output on the terminal.

    - A return is a statement or specifically defined data that you can see when console.logging.

  Researched answer:
    - A console.() is a method that writes a message "log", to the console.

    - A return is a reusable piece of code that is meant to stop the function and always "return" an output of information through the argument.



4. In regards to functions, what is an argument?

  Your answer:
    - An argument to a function is a way to begin to manipulate the code function.

  Researched answer:
    - An argument is any outside information needed so the function can work properly.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer:
    - Pair programming is when you are paired up with someone and you work together to complete the task at hand. One is the driver and types(drives), and inputs information if and when needed, the other is the navigator and types(navigates) the driver in the right direction while looking up proper ways to complete task at hand.

  Researched answer:
    - Pair Programming uses a driver/ navigator method. Two pairs of eyes, knowledge/ skills to focus on making quality code, they work together to stay focused and deepen their own knowledge of code by talking about it together in tandem. The driver has his hands on the keyboard and is responsible for entering in all information instructed from the navigator to the code.



6. What is TDD? Describe the work flow associated with TDD.

  Your answer:
    - Honestly, I am drawing a blank, I know it has testing in it??...ok I looked it up...but only what TDD is as a term.
    So I believe Test Driven Development is a way of developing code that you write out more like a sentence and can test through terminal, using yarn jest on the specific file.


  Researched answer:
    - Test Driven Development is a process rediscovered by Kent Black, it focuses on the aspect of testing the development first, then writing a a production code and then revising the code until it passes the test.


7. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer:
    - Plain and simple, you as our teachers and our group is oh so helpful. The many strategies you guys have given us I am implementing and in no time I will see the results. Along with that I have a tendency to fix or do it all on my own...which I am still doing now honestly, but the encouragement to speak up is making me more willing to reach out. It is just the opposite of how i have worked/ lived almost my whole life thus far...

    - And breaks!! To be upfront, I quit smoking nicotine a week into October, to start my life fresh before class. I am honestly doing super good barely think about it. Although it definitely makes it hard to focus on anything, and headaches with all the knew learning are a daily struggle, but I SHALL PUSH on and SUCCESS will be MINE with everyones helps! =)


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

- Classes
    - Classes are blueprints for objects and have there own scope like functions, they have there own type of data that have a particular type of behavior nested inside it.
      - Including:
          - constructor - which is its own method in creating and initializing objects.
          - this. which refers to the object it belongs too.
          - new that creates new instance of a class and object

- React
    - React is a component based web designer that can be built in smaller sections for webpages, mobile apps and native apps. created from Facebook to be completely scaleable.

- React State
    - React State is an object that stores a components specific data and determines how the component will render and behave.

- CRUD
    - CRUD stands for "Create, Read, Update and Delete", necessary steps to create a persisting storage application.
